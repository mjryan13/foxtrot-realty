<p> 
Located in Columbus, Ohio The Foxtrot Real Estate owns and operates approximately 15,000 rental apartments in 45 communities across ten states. Supporting a true vertically-integrated operation, Foxtrot acquires multi-family real estate in premier suburban markets, and improves short and long term performance through hands-on management, and through value-add renovation programs that reposition the properties to lead their respective marketplaces.<br>
<br>
M3N, founder of The Foxtrot Organization, identified the focus of the company at its outset, observing that "The Largest Part of the Market is the Middle.” With a focus on working households who seek convenient locations, well-appointed homes and first-class amenities, M3N strives to provide all at affordable rent levels. Properties are located in leading school districts with a convenient proximity to regional employment centers. M3N maintains a reliable level of performance by concentrating on assets that are less vulnerable to real estate market cycles. The investment strategy is long-term oriented, focused on economic fundamentals and expected to protect against (and benefit from) inflationary pressures.<br>
<br>
Foxtrot's team includes numerous executives whose experience with the company exceeds 30 years. The company maintains an opportunistic-focus and quality-driven culture, allowing it to grow to more than 500 employees whose skill sets includes asset management, property management, construction, leasing, marketing, maintenance, acquisitions, risk-management, IT, finance, accounting and all other related support functions. Foxtrot has maintained an entrepreneurial mindset while welcoming a 2nd generation of family into its management structure. The company is well-prepared for long term stability and well-positioned for continued growth.<br>
<br>
Foxtrot’s stellar reputation among real estate professionals is a particular source of pride and its investment strategy is especially responsive, even in the context of the dynamic multi-family sector. Its attention to detail in every component of acquisition – from identifying markets to inspecting property to financing specification – reduces risk while rewards employees and residents who enjoy the benefits of a high-performing company that operates desirable communities.<br>
